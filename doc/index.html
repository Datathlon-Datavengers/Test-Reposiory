        <h3>Pre-Planning / Introduction</h3>
        <p>
            Before the adventure begins, there‚Äôs a crucial planning stage that sets the foundation for an unforgettable experience. This is where the Dungeon Master (DM) works closely with the players to bring their characters to life.

During this phase, players will develop their character's stats, abilities, and a compelling backstory. This isn't just about rolling dice; it's about crafting a hero (or anti-hero!) who will shape the narrative. A character's background can provide the DM with unique plot hooks, personal quests, and twists that make the game more immersive and tailored to the group.

This is also an important time for everyone to get to know each other. Players can meet their fellow adventurers and, most importantly, the DM. This is your chance to discuss the DM's style, including their approach to game rules, storytelling, and world-building. This pre-planning stage ensures that everyone is on the same page, allowing you to decide if the group and the game style are the right fit for you before you ever roll for initiative.

        <h3>Game Sessions</h3>
        <p>
            Welcome! You might be wondering how a Dungeons & Dragons game works. Think of a game as a story.

Some games are long-term Campaigns, like a TV series, where players meet regularly for months to tell one big, epic story. They're amazing, but they require a big time commitment.

That's where One-Shots come in. These are complete stories that start and finish in a single session, typically lasting a few hours. They're perfect for newcomers because they require no long-term commitment and are quick to set up with pre-made characters and adventures.

At our event, one-shots are the perfect way to get started, discover the magic of D&D, and jump right into the action!
